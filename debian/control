Description: cryptographic algorithms and protocols for Python
 A collection of cryptographic algorithms and protocols, implemented
 for use from Python. Among the contents of the package:
 .
  * Hash functions: MD2, MD4.
  * Block encryption algorithms: AES, ARC2, Blowfish, CAST, DES, Triple-DES.
  * Stream encryption algorithms: ARC4, simple XOR.
  * Public-key algorithms: RSA, DSA, ElGamal, qNEW.
  * Protocols: All-or-nothing transforms, chaffing/winnowing.
  * Miscellaneous: RFC1751 module for converting 128-key keys 
    into a set of English words, primality testing.
 .
 This is an empty dummy package that always depends on a package built
 for Debian's default Python version.
